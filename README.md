**Nik Tyresens Battery of Cognitive Tasks Programmed in PsychoPy**

This repository contains a growing battery of cognitive tasks programmed in PsychoPy. These are free to use with credit (see license).

The reason for developing these tasks is twofold: to create piloted and tested instructions in Danish (as I do research in Denmark, mostly with native speakers of Danish) and to not rely on commercial software, non-GDPR-friendly online platforms and/or closed-source solutions with hardcoded English material. As much as possible, I try to structure tasks so that instructions and/or stimuli are easy to switch out with something else if needed.
